    The results of the selected tool are published using a unique ID (i.e. URL) which must not be already used by
    another tool in this job. This ID is used as link to the results, so choose a short and meaningful name.
    If you leave the ID field empty, then the built-in default ID of the registered tool will be used.

    You can also override the display name of the tool. This name is used in details views, trend captions, and hyper
    links. If you leave the name field empty, then the built-in default name of the registered tool will be used.
