description.files=<a href="{0}">Fileset 'includes'</a> \
                 setting that specifies the workspace files to scan for tasks, such as '**/*.java'. \
                 You can define multiple filesets using comma as a separator, e.g. '**/*.c, **/*.h'. \
                 Basedir of the fileset is <a href="ws/">the workspace root</a>. \
                 If no value is set, then the default '**/*.java' is used.
description.exclude.files=<a href="{0}">Fileset 'excludes'</a> \
                 setting that specifies the workspace files to exclude scanning for tasks, such as library source files. \
                 Basedir of the fileset is <a href="ws/">the workspace root</a>.
description.tags=Configure the tags identifiers that should be looked for in the workspace files. \
                For each priority a comma separated list of tags could be defined, e.g. TODO, FIXME, etc. \
                Only alphanumerical characters are allowed as tags as these strings are pasted into a regular \
                expression. See option ''Regular expression'' if you want to control the regular expression on your own.

description.asRegexp=Treat the tag identifiers as regular expression. Note that the regular expression must contain \
                two capturing groups, the first one is interpreted as tag name, the second one as message. An example \
                of such a regular expression would be ''^.*(TODO(?:[0-9]*))(.*)$''.
description.ignoreCase=Ignore the case of the the tag identifiers.
description.example=Enter an example message that will be scanned for open tasks with the \
  properties specified in the entries above.
